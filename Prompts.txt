AI Usage Log – Fan-Out Engine Assignment

Tool Used:
- ChatGPT
- Cursor (occasionally)

Purpose of AI Usage:
AI tools were used strictly as a productivity aid for:
- Boilerplate generation
- Clarifying Java 21 Virtual Thread semantics
- Reviewing architectural approaches at a high level

Prompts Used (Representative):

1. "Design a high-throughput Java fan-out ingestion engine using Virtual Threads."
2. "Explain how to implement rate limiting using Semaphore in Java."
3. "Provide a simple retry pattern with max retry limit."
4. "How can a BlockingQueue provide backpressure in a producer-consumer system?"
5. "What is a clean way to structure transformation strategies in Java?"

Manual Work & Validation:
- All core components (FanOutOrchestrator, FileIngestor, RetryExecutor, DLQ, MetricsReporter)
  were manually written and iteratively refined.
- Concurrency, retry behavior, and backpressure were validated through:
  - Local execution
  - Controlled failures
  - Unit and integration testing

No AI-generated code was used without review.
All architectural and implementation decisions were manually verified and tested.

This log is provided in the interest of transparency.
